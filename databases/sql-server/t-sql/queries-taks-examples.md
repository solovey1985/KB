Here are some questions to help you practice building queries using the AdventureWorks database, ranging from simple to advanced:

### Simple:

1. Retrieve all product names from the `Product` table.
2. List all customers' first and last names from the `Customer` table.
3. Find all orders placed on a specific date from the `SalesOrderHeader` table.
4. Get the total number of products in the `Product` table.
5. Display all unique colors available for products.

### Intermediate:

6. List all products along with their categories.
7. Find the total sales for each product (use the `SalesOrderDetail` table).
8. Retrieve all customers who have not placed any orders.
9. List the top 10 most expensive products.
10. Find all orders placed by a specific customer using their `CustomerID`.

### Joins and Aggregations:

11. Determine the total quantity of each product sold.
12. List all customers along with the total amount they've spent.
13. Retrieve the total sales for each year.
14. Find products that have never been ordered.
15. List the top 5 customers who have placed the most orders.

### Subqueries and CTEs:

16. Find the average price of all products whose price is above the overall average.
17. Retrieve products that have been ordered more than the average number of orders.
18. List customers who have placed more orders than the average customer.
19. Using a CTE, find the month-over-month growth in sales.

### Advanced:

20. For each product, calculate the percentage contribution of its sales to the total sales.
21. Find all customers who have ordered the same set of products.
22. Determine the month with the highest sales for each year.
23. Using window functions, rank products based on their total sales.
24. Retrieve the last three orders placed by each customer.

Remember, the key to mastering SQL is consistent practice. Try to solve each question, and then attempt to optimize your solution or approach it from a different angle.
