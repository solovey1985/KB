## 1. **Filtering**
Used to filter a sequence based on some condition.

- `Where()`: Filters elements based on a predicate.
    ```csharp
    var evens = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);
    ```

## 2. **Projection**
Transforms each element of a sequence to a different form.

- `Select()`: Projects each element of a sequence.
    ```csharp
    var squares = numbers.Select(n => n * n);
    ```
- `SelectMany()`: Projects sequences and flattens the resulting sequences into one sequence.
    ```csharp
    var allOrders = customers.SelectMany(c => c.Orders);
    ```

## 3. **Ordering**
Sorts the elements of a sequence.

- `OrderBy()`: Sorts elements based on a key.
    ```csharp
    var ordered = numbers.OrderBy(n => n);
    ```
- `OrderByDescending()`: Sorts elements in descending order.
- `ThenBy()` & `ThenByDescending()`: Used after `OrderBy` or `OrderByDescending` for secondary sorting.
    ```csharp
    var people = persons.OrderBy(p => p.LastName).ThenBy(p => p.FirstName);
    ```

## 4. **Aggregation**
Computes a value from a sequence.

- `Count()`: Counts elements in a sequence.
    ```csharp
    var totalEvens = numbers.Count(n => n % 2 == 0);
    ```
- `Sum()`, `Average()`, `Min()`, `Max()`: Calculate sum, average, minimum, and maximum respectively.
    ```csharp
    var total = numbers.Sum();
    ```

## 5. **Partitioning**
Divides a sequence into sections.

- `Skip()`: Skips a specified number of elements in a sequence.
- `Take()`: Returns a specified number of contiguous elements.
    ```csharp
    var subset = numbers.Skip(5).Take(10);
    ```

## 6. **Joining**
Combines sequences based on matching keys.

- `Join()`: Performs an inner join on two sequences.
    ```csharp
    var result = persons.Join(orders, p => p.ID, o => o.PersonID, (p, o) => new { p.Name, o.OrderDate });
    ```
- `GroupJoin()`: Performs a group join.

## 7. **Set Operations**
Performs operations on sets.

- `Distinct()`: Removes duplicates from a sequence.
    ```csharp
    var uniqueNumbers = numbers.Distinct();
    ```
- `Union()`, `Intersect()`, `Except()`: Perform union, intersection, and set difference operations respectively.

## 8. **Grouping**
Groups elements of a sequence.

- `GroupBy()`: Groups elements based on a key.
    ```csharp
    var numberGroups = numbers.GroupBy(n => n % 2 == 0 ? "Even" : "Odd");
    ```

## 9. **Quantifiers**
Determines if elements in a sequence satisfy a condition.

- `Any()`: Checks if any elements in a sequence satisfy a condition.
    ```csharp
    var hasOdd = numbers.Any(n => n % 2 != 0);
    ```
- `All()`: Checks if all elements in a sequence satisfy a condition.
    ```csharp
    var areAllEven = numbers.All(n => n % 2 == 0);
    ```
- `Contains()`: Checks if a sequence contains a specified element.
    ```csharp
    var hasSeven = numbers.Contains(7);
    ```

## 10. **Element Retrieval**
Gets specific elements from a sequence.

- `First()`, `FirstOrDefault()`: Return the first element, or the first element that satisfies a condition.
    ```csharp
    var firstEven = numbers.First(n => n % 2 == 0);
    ```
- `Last()`, `LastOrDefault()`: Return the last element or the last element that satisfies a condition.
- `Single()`, `SingleOrDefault()`: Return a single element or an element that satisfies a condition.

## 11. **Generation**
Creates a sequence of values.

- `Range()`: Generates a sequence of consecutive integers.
    ```csharp
    var range = Enumerable.Range(1, 10);
    ```
- `Repeat()`: Generates a sequence that contains one repeated value.
    ```csharp
    var tens = Enumerable.Repeat(10, 5);
    ```

## 12. **Concatenation**
Combines sequences.

- `Concat()`: Appends two sequences.
    ```csharp
    var combined = numbers1.Concat(numbers2);
    ```

## 13. **Equality**
Determines if two sequences are equal.

- `SequenceEqual()`: Determines whether two sequences are equal by comparing their elements.
    ```csharp
    bool areEqual = list1.SequenceEqual(list2);
    ```

## 14. **Conversion**
Converts a sequence to a different form.

- `ToArray()`, `ToList()`, `ToDictionary()`: Converts a sequence to an array, list, or dictionary respectively.

This list covers many of the commonly used LINQ methods, but it's worth noting that LINQ offers even more specialized methods and overloads for these methods to provide greater flexibility. Exploring them in practice and referencing the official documentation will give deeper insights.
