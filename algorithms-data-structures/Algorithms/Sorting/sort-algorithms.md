## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. The basic idea is to repeatedly swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

### Time Complexity: O(n^2)
### Space Complexity: O(1)

Here is a simple C# code snippet:

```csharp
public static void BubbleSort(int[] array)
{
    int n = array.Length;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++)
        {
            if (array[j] > array[j + 1])
            {
                // swap
                int temp = array[j];
                array[j] = array[j + 1];
                array[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Selection Sort

Selection Sort works by selecting the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the first element in the unsorted part.

### Time Complexity: O(n^2)
### Space Complexity: O(1)

Here's a C# implementation:

```csharp
public static void SelectionSort(int[] array)
{
    int n = array.Length;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
    {
        int minIndex = i;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++)
        {
            if (array[j] < array[minIndex])
            {
                minIndex = j;
            }
        }
        // swap
        int temp = array[minIndex];
        array[minIndex] = array[i];
        array[i] = temp;
    }
}
```

## Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort works by taking elements one-by-one and inserting them into their correct position in a sorted sub-array.

### Time Complexity: O(n^2)
### Space Complexity: O(1)

```csharp
public static void InsertionSort(int[] array)
{
    int n = array.Length;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    {
        int key = array[i];
        int j = i - 1;
        while (j >= 0 && array[j] > key)
        {
            array[j + 1] = array[j];
            j = j - 1;
        }
        array[j + 1] = key;
    }
}
```

## Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm.

### Time Complexity: O(n log n)
### Space Complexity: O(n)

```csharp
public static void MergeSort(int[] array, int left, int right)
{
    if (left < right)
    {
        int middle = (left + right) / 2;
        MergeSort(array, left, middle);
        MergeSort(array, middle + 1, right);
        Merge(array, left, middle, right);
    }
}

public static void Merge(int[] array, int left, int middle, int right)
{
    // Implementation of the merging logic here.
}
```

---

## Quick Sort

Quick Sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm but works differently than Merge Sort.

### Time Complexity: O(n log n) (average)
### Space Complexity: O(log n)

```csharp
public static void QuickSort(int[] array, int low, int high)
{
    if (low < high)
    {
        int pi = Partition(array, low, high);
        QuickSort(array, low, pi - 1);
        QuickSort(array, pi + 1, high);
    }
}

public static int Partition(int[] array, int low, int high)
{
    // Implementation of the partitioning logic here.
}
```

## Summary

We've looked at some of the most popular sorting algorithms and examined their time and space complexities. Understanding these algorithms is not only critical for interviews but also for solving real-world problems efficiently.

Certainly! Here's a comparison table summarizing the key characteristics of the sorting algorithms we've discussed.

| Algorithm      | Time Complexity (Best) | Time Complexity (Average) | Time Complexity (Worst) | Space Complexity | Stability | Adaptivity |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-----------|------------|

| Selection Sort | \(O(n^2)\)             | \(O(n^2)\)                 | \(O(n^2)\)               | \(O(1)\)          | No        | No         |
| Insertion Sort | \(O(n)\)               | \(O(n^2)\)                 | \(O(n^2)\)               | \(O(1)\)          | Yes       | Yes        |
| Merge Sort     | \(O(n \log n)\)        | \(O(n \log n)\)            | \(O(n \log n)\)          | \(O(n)\)          | Yes       | No         |
| Quick Sort     | \(O(n \log n)\)        | \(O(n \log n)\)            | \(O(n^2)\)               | \(O(\log n)\)     | No        | No         |

### Key Points to Consider:

- **Time Complexity**: This metric tells you how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input grows.
  
- **Space Complexity**: This is an indication of how much additional memory the algorithm needs.

- **Stability**: A sorting algorithm is stable if it maintains the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output.

- **Adaptivity**: An adaptive algorithm performs better on inputs that are partially sorted.

These are general observations, and the actual performance can depend on the specific details of each algorithm, as well as the type of data you're working with.
