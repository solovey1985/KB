C# 10, like its predecessors, brought numerous updates to the language. Here's a summary of the major features in C# 10, illustrated with class examples:
- [1. **Record structs**](#1-record-structs)
- [2. **Improved Interpolated Strings**](#2-improved-interpolated-strings)
- [3. **Global using Directives**](#3-global-using-directives)
- [4. **File-scoped Namespaces**](#4-file-scoped-namespaces)
- [5. **Extended Property Patterns**](#5-extended-property-patterns)
- [6. **Constant Interpolated Strings**](#6-constant-interpolated-strings)
- [7. **Null Parameter Checking**](#7-null-parameter-checking)
- [8. **Lambda Improvements**](#8-lambda-improvements)
- [9. **Default in Deconstruction**](#9-default-in-deconstruction)
- [10. **Required Properties**](#10-required-properties)
- [11. **Enhanced #line Directives**](#11-enhanced-line-directives)


## 1. **Record structs**

   Just like record classes from C# 9, but for structs. They provide value semantics with the ease of declaration that records offer.

   ```csharp
   public record struct Point(int X, int Y);
   ```

## 2. **Improved Interpolated Strings**

   C# 10 introduces a way to make interpolated strings into `FormattableString` instances without creating intermediate strings, improving efficiency.

   ```csharp
   int x = 5;
   FormattableString str = $"The value of x is {x}.";
   ```

## 3. **Global using Directives**

   This feature allows for specifying using directives that apply to the entire project. Often placed in a file named `Usings.cs` or similar at the root of a project.

   ```csharp
   global using System;
   global using System.Collections.Generic;
   ```

## 4. **File-scoped Namespaces**

   A more concise way to declare namespaces. Instead of wrapping the entire file in a namespace block, you can use:

   ```csharp
   namespace MyNamespace;
   
   public class MyClass
   {
       // class implementation
   }
   ```

## 5. **Extended Property Patterns**

   Enhancements to pattern matching, which allow for more granular matching on properties.

   ```csharp
   public record Person(string Name, int Age);

   public class PatternDemo
   {
       public bool IsAdult(Person person)
       {
           return person is { Age: >= 18 };
       }
   }
   ```

## 6. **Constant Interpolated Strings**

   Interpolated strings can now be used to create constants.

   ```csharp
   const string Name = "John";
   const string Greeting = $"Hello, {Name}!";
   ```

## 7. **Null Parameter Checking**

   Simplifies null validation for method parameters.

   ```csharp
   public void Display(string name!)
   {
       // If 'name' is null, a ArgumentNullException is thrown.
       Console.WriteLine(name);
   }
   ```

## 8. **Lambda Improvements**

   Lambdas can now have attributes and can also have a natural type inferred, allowing them to be used in more scenarios.

   ```csharp
   Func<int, int> doubler = [return: MyCustomAttribute] x => x * 2;
   ```

## 9. **Default in Deconstruction**

   You can use the `default` keyword during deconstruction to discard particular values.

   ```csharp
   var (first, _, _) = (1, 2, 3);  // Only cares about the first value.
   ```

## 10. **Required Properties**

   Classes and records can have properties that must be set during object initialization.

   ```csharp
   public class Location
   {
       public string Name { get; init; required; }
   }
   
   var place = new Location { Name = "Beach" };
   ```

## 11. **Enhanced #line Directives**

   `#line` can be used with a single number to set the source-line for the next line of code.

   ```csharp
   #line 42
   throw new Exception();  // This appears to be from line 42.
   ```

These are the significant features of C# 10, demonstrated with class or code examples. As always, each new version of C# focuses on improving developer productivity, code readability, and safety.
