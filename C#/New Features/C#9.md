C# 9 introduced more features that further advanced the language and aimed to make it even more expressive, safe, and efficient. Here's a rundown of major C# 9 features, with class examples:

- [1. **Records**](#1-records)
- [2. **Init-only Properties**](#2-init-only-properties)
- [3. **Top-level Statements**](#3-top-level-statements)
- [4. **Pattern Matching Enhancements**](#4-pattern-matching-enhancements)
- [5. **With Expressions**](#5-with-expressions)
- [6. **Target-typed New Expressions**](#6-target-typed-new-expressions)
- [7. **Covariant Return Types**](#7-covariant-return-types)
- [8. **Attributes on Local Functions**](#8-attributes-on-local-functions)
- [9. **Native Integers (`nint` and `nuint`)**](#9-native-integers-nint-and-nuint)


## 1. **Records**

   Records provide a way to define simple types with value semantics. They're essentially immutable reference types.

   ```csharp
   public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName);
   ```

   You can also use `with` expressions to create copies of records with modifications:

   ```csharp
   var person = new Person("John", "Doe");
   var updatedPerson = person with { FirstName = "Jane" };
   ```

## 2. **Init-only Properties**

   These properties allow objects to be immutable after construction.

   ```csharp
   public class Product
   {
       public string Name { get; init; }
       public decimal Price { get; init; }
   }
   ```

## 3. **Top-level Statements**

   You no longer need to wrap code in a class and method for simple programs. This can be particularly useful for small scripts or when first learning C#. For example, a program can be as simple as:

   ```csharp
   Console.WriteLine("Hello, C# 9!");
   ```

   This will be a valid C# 9 program.

## 4. **Pattern Matching Enhancements**

   C# 9 introduced more patterns:

   ```csharp
   public class PatternDemo
   {
       public void Display(object obj)
       {
           if (obj is not null)  // `not` pattern
           {
               Console.WriteLine(obj);
           }
           
           if (obj is int { } i)  // Property pattern and declaration pattern combined
           {
               Console.WriteLine($"It's an integer with value: {i}");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

## 5. **With Expressions**

   For records, `with` expressions let you create a new object that's a copy of an existing one, with specified changes.

   ```csharp
   public record Pet(string Name, int Age);

   var oldPet = new Pet("Rex", 5);
   var youngPet = oldPet with { Age = 1 };  // Creates a new pet, same name, but age 1.
   ```

## 6. **Target-typed New Expressions**

   Reduces boilerplate by inferring the type you're trying to create a new instance of.

   ```csharp
   List<int> numbers = new();  // Equivalent to: new List<int>();
   ```

## 7. **Covariant Return Types**

   Allows for more specific return types in overridden methods.

   ```csharp
   public class Animal { }
   public class Cat : Animal { }

   public class AnimalShelter
   {
       public virtual Animal GetAnimal() => new Animal();
   }

   public class CatShelter : AnimalShelter
   {
       public override Cat GetAnimal() => new Cat();  // Notice the return type is `Cat`, not `Animal`.
   }
   ```

## 8. **Attributes on Local Functions**

   You can now apply attributes to local functions.

   ```csharp
   public class AttributeDemo
   {
       public void Process()
       {
           [Obsolete("This is an obsolete local function.")]
           void LocalFunction()
           {
               Console.WriteLine("This function is obsolete.");
           }

           LocalFunction();
       }
   }
   ```

## 9. **Native Integers (`nint` and `nuint`)**

   New built-in integral types that are intended for scenarios that need to align with native-sized integers.

   ```csharp
   public class NativeIntegerDemo
   {
       public void DisplaySize()
       {
           nint nativeInteger = 10;
           Console.WriteLine($"Size of nint: {sizeof(nint)} bytes");
       }
   }
   ```

These are some of the major features in C# 9 with illustrative class examples. The language enhancements in C# 9 continue to improve clarity, reduce boilerplate, and enhance safety in various scenarios.
