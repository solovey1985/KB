### Introduction
Thread synchronization is a procedure that should be avoided whenever possible.

---

### Best Practices
- Regardless of the type of locking objects, always aim to create code where the lock is held for the shortest time possible.
- Build your class libraries based on the following standard: All static methods should be thread-safe, while instance methods should not be.

---

### Volatile Keyword
- The `volatile` keyword indicates that a field can be modified by multiple threads running simultaneously.
- Fields declared as `volatile` are not optimized by the compiler for access via a separate thread.
- The `volatile` keyword can be applied to fields of various types, including reference types, pointer types, and specific value types.
- Local variables cannot be declared as volatile.

---

### AutoResetEvent
- `AutoResetEvent` allows threads to interact with each other by passing signals.
- Calling `Set` signals the `AutoResetEvent` to release the waiting thread.
- If a thread calls the `WaitOne` method and the `AutoResetEvent` is in a signal state, the thread is not blocked.

---

### ManualResetEvent
- `ManualResetEvent` allows threads to interact with each other by passing signals.
- Threads that call the `WaitOne` method in `ManualResetEvent` will be blocked, waiting for a signal.

---

### Semaphore
- Use the `Semaphore` class to manage access to a resource pool.
- The semaphore counter decreases by one each time a thread enters the semaphore and increases by one when a thread releases the semaphore.
- Semaphores, like mutexes, can be local and system (named).

---

### Mutex
- A Mutex is a primitive that provides exclusive access to a common resource to only one synchronization thread.
- If a thread terminates while owning a mutex, the mutex is said to be abandoned.
- Mutexes come in two types: local mutexes (unnamed) and named system mutexes.
