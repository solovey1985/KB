### Introduction
Thread synchronization is a procedure that should be avoided whenever possible.

---

### Best Practices
- Regardless of the type of locking objects, always aim to create code where the lock is held for the shortest time possible.
- Build your class libraries based on the following standard: All static methods should be thread-safe, while instance methods should not be.

---

### Volatile Keyword
- The `volatile` keyword indicates that a field can be modified by multiple threads running simultaneously.
- Fields declared as `volatile` are not optimized by the compiler for access via a separate thread.
- The `volatile` keyword can be applied to fields of various types, including reference types, pointer types, and specific value types.
- Local variables cannot be declared as volatile.

---

### AutoResetEvent
- `AutoResetEvent` allows threads to interact with each other by passing signals.
- Calling `Set` signals the `AutoResetEvent` to release the waiting thread.
- If a thread calls the `WaitOne` method and the `AutoResetEvent` is in a signal state, the thread is not blocked.

---

### ManualResetEvent
- `ManualResetEvent` allows threads to interact with each other by passing signals.
- Threads that call the `WaitOne` method in `ManualResetEvent` will be blocked, waiting for a signal.

---
#### Diference between ManualResetEvent and AutoResetEvent
`ManualResetEvent` and `AutoResetEvent` are synchronization primitives provided by .NET for inter-thread communication and synchronization. They are part of the `System.Threading` namespace and are used to coordinate the execution of threads.

The main difference between `ManualResetEvent` and `AutoResetEvent` lies in how they behave when signaled and reset:

1. **ManualResetEvent:**
   - When a `ManualResetEvent` is signaled (`Set()` is called), all waiting threads are released.
   - The event remains in the signaled state until explicitly reset using the `Reset()` method.
   - This means that multiple threads can enter the signaled state simultaneously until the event is manually reset.
   - It is useful when you want to notify multiple threads and keep them running until the event is explicitly reset.

```csharp
ManualResetEvent manualEvent = new ManualResetEvent(false); // Initially not signaled

// Thread 1
manualEvent.WaitOne();  // Blocks until event is set

// Thread 2
manualEvent.WaitOne();  // Also blocks until event is set

// Later in code
manualEvent.Set();      // Releases both Thread 1 and Thread 2
```

2. **AutoResetEvent:**
   - When an `AutoResetEvent` is signaled (`Set()` is called), only one waiting thread is released.
   - The event automatically resets itself to a non-signaled state after a single thread has been released.
   - If multiple threads are waiting, only one of them will proceed, and the event will reset immediately.
   - It is useful when you want to notify one waiting thread and automatically reset the event.

```csharp
AutoResetEvent autoEvent = new AutoResetEvent(false); // Initially not signaled

// Thread 1
autoEvent.WaitOne();  // Blocks until event is set

// Thread 2
autoEvent.WaitOne();  // Blocks until event is set (Thread 1 releases the lock)

// Later in code
autoEvent.Set();      // Releases only one waiting thread (either Thread 1 or Thread 2)
```

In summary:
- `ManualResetEvent` is manually reset and can release multiple threads until explicitly reset.
- `AutoResetEvent` is automatically reset after releasing one waiting thread.

 Choose the appropriate synchronization primitive based on your synchronization requirements. If you want to notify multiple threads and keep them running until manually reset, use `ManualResetEvent`. If you want to notify one thread and automatically reset the event, use `AutoResetEvent`.

### Semaphore
- Use the `Semaphore` class to manage access to a resource pool.
- The semaphore counter decreases by one each time a thread enters the semaphore and increases by one when a thread releases the semaphore.
- Semaphores, like mutexes, can be local and system (named).

---

### Mutex
- A Mutex is a primitive that provides exclusive access to a common resource to only one synchronization thread.
- If a thread terminates while owning a mutex, the mutex is said to be abandoned.
- Mutexes come in two types: local mutexes (unnamed) and named system mutexes.
